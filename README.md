# PHP Discussion Forum

By: Connor Doman

## Proposal

### Project Description

Selected Project: MyDiscussionForum (StackOverflow Clone)

A discussion forum where users can post questions and answers, and vote on them. Users can also comment on posts and vote on comments. Users can also delete their own posts and comments. Users can also be designated as moderators, who can delete other users' posts and comments.

### Features

-   Users can register and login to the site
-   Registered users can post text, links, and comments
-   Registered users can edit posts and comments
-   Registered users can vote on posts and comments
-   Unregistered users can view posts and comments, but not edit or vote
-   Users designated as moderators can also delete other members posts and comments.
-   Users can sort posts and comments by date and vote count
-   Users will have an "appeal" score based on the way their posts and comments are voted on. This score will effect the weight of that user's votes on comments and posts.
-   A post's score will be a combination of weighted votes from viewers and the appeal score of the user who posted it.
