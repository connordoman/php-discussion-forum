# COSC 360 Web Programming Project

By: Connor Doman

## Proposal

### Team Members

Name: **[REDACTED]**, Student Number: **[REDACTED]** ([GitHub](https://github.com/connordoman))

### Project Description

Selected Project: MyDiscussionForum (Reddit Clone)

### Requirements

-   Users can register and login to the site
-   Registered users can post text, links, and comments
-   Registered users can edit posts and comments
-   Registered users can vote on posts and comments
-   Unregistered users can view posts and comments, but not edit or vote
-   Users designated as moderators can also delete other members posts and comments.
-   Users can sort posts and comments by date and vote count
-   Users will have an "appeal" score based on the way their posts and comments are voted on. This score will effect the weight of that user's votes on comments and posts.
-   A post's score will be a combination of weighted votes from viewers and the appeal score of the user who posted it.

As per `Baseline Objectives` on the course website, these specific requirements will also be met:

>
> Website administrator’s objectives:
